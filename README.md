## Contents

In this repository, there are several methods to optimize *the Regression Task* including:

* Least Linear Squares
* Stochastic Gradient Descent with Adam Optimizer
* Minibatch Gradient Descent

In addition to these algorithms, there are some methods to evaluate the model. To start training, simply use `.run` method for each algorithm.
